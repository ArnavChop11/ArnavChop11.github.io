  aboutMe:
    `Hi, my name is Arnav Chopra and I am a Computer Engineering student at The University of Illinois at 
    Urbana-Champaign. I am deeply interested in ASIC/FPGA development, specifically in the fields of AI 
    acceleration and HFT. Currently I am working as a hardware engineer at HeftAI, a stealth startup focused 
    on creating cutting edge platform-agnostic high-performance machine learning infrastructure. In this role, 
    I have honed in my skills with SystemVerilog, C, and verification by working on the architecture and 
    prototyping of a stripped-down systolic array accelerator optimized for deterministic, low-latency INT8 
    matrix multiplication with BF16 accumulation. I also have strong project experience, and have had the
    opporunity to work on many exciting and challenging projects involving computer architecture and 
    AI acceleration. This includes a Pipelined Out-Of-Order RISC-V Processor, a Handwritten Digit Recognition 
    System built on an FPGA, and a deeply optimized Convolutional Layer using CUDA. All these projects are further
    detailed below. I am seeking internship/full-time opportunities in ASIC/FPGA design and/or verification, 
    and am always excited to learn about new technologies.`,

      name: "Pipelined Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor",
      description: `Our team designed and implemented an out-of-order RISC-V processor using the Explicit Register Renaming (ERR) microarchitecture, written entirely in SystemVerilog. The design supports the RV32IM instruction set with advanced features that increase throughput in numerous benchmarks 
      
      These advanced features include: 
      
      Pipelined Cache:
      We designed a parameterized pipelined instruction and data cache to improve throughput and reduce memory latency. Advanced features included back-to-back cache hits, PLRU replacement for any power-of-two associativity, and branch-aware memory scheduling. Verified with randomized testbenches and full benchmark integration, the cache eliminated critical memory paths and lowered the processorâ€™s clock period to 2100 ns. A 2-way 64-set cache provided the best balance of power and delay, meeting benchmark requirements efficiently 

      Split LSQ
      We implemented a split Load-Store Queue (LSQ) that enables loads to issue out of order between in-order stores, improving memory concurrency. Loads and stores share the same functional unit but dispatch to separate reservation stations, with additional checks to ensure correctness with pending stores and branches

      Branch Predictor
      We implemented a two-level branch predictor with a branch target buffer (BTB) integrated into the fetch stage, ensuring predictions occur without altering the pipeline path. The predictor uses PC bits to index into a local history table (LHT), which then selects entries in the pattern history table (PHT) to determine branch behavior. The BTB, embedded within the LHT, provides the next PC value when predicting taken. Mispredictions trigger updates from the execute stage, with the PHT implemented in SRAM and the LHT/BTB in flip-flops, enabling accurate and efficient prediction
      
      Overall, we built a fully functional out-of-order RISC-V processor with advanced memory and branch features, validated through rigorous benchmarking. The design balanced performance, power, and delay while giving me hands-on experience in RTL design, verification, and architectural optimization

      name: "Handwritten Digit Recognition Using CNN on FPGA",
      description: `In this project, we created a handwritten digit recognition system on the FPGA, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The user is able to input ahandwritten digit 0-9 that is 28x28 pixels and receive an output that identifies the digit that was drawn.

      To translate CNN inference into RTL, we created dedicated hardware for two Convolution+ReLU layers, a max pooling layer, and two fully connected layers. Memory management was a major challenge due to over 100,000 parameters and nearly 10,000 intermediate neuron values. We addressed this by preloading parameters into ROMs and allocating intermediate results in BRAMs, enabling parallel access for convolutions. All floating-point parameters were converted into 9-bit fixed-point (Q3.6) representation to reduce FPGA resource usage while retaining accuracy. An FSM controlled the sequencing of layer operations, balancing parallelization for performance against serialization for hardware efficiency

      The design achieved stable inference at 118.9 MHz with a total power consumption of 473 mW (75 mW static, 398 mW dynamic). Resource utilization included ~19,000 LUTs, 32 BRAMs, 4,318 flip-flops, and only 3 DSP slices, showing the efficiency of our fixed-point approach. Simulation waveforms confirmed correct top-3 digit predictions and validated classification across multiple test images

      This project showcased the end-to-end process of implementing a CNN in hardware: preprocessing images, managing parameters, building custom convolution/pooling/FC modules, and integrating them into a functional inference pipeline. It provided hands-on experience with SystemVerilog, FPGA memory management, and hardware acceleration for AI, demonstrating the potential of FPGAs for efficient machine learning inference
