  aboutMe:
    `Hi, my name is Arnav Chopra and I am a Computer Engineering student at The University of Illinois at 
    Urbana-Champaign. I am deeply interested in ASIC/FPGA development, specifically in the fields of AI 
    acceleration and HFT. Currently I am working as a hardware engineer at HeftAI, a stealth startup focused 
    on creating cutting edge platform-agnostic high-performance machine learning infrastructure. In this role, 
    I have honed in my skills with SystemVerilog, C, and verification by working on the architecture and 
    prototyping of a stripped-down systolic array accelerator optimized for deterministic, low-latency INT8 
    matrix multiplication with BF16 accumulation. I also have strong project experience, and have had the
    opporunity to work on many exciting and challenging projects involving computer architecture and 
    AI acceleration. This includes a Pipelined Out-Of-Order RISC-V Processor, a Handwritten Digit Recognition 
    System built on an FPGA, and a deeply optimized Convolutional Layer using CUDA. All these projects are further
    detailed below. I am currently working on a [HFT project here]. I am seeking internship/full-time opportunities
    in ASIC/FPGA design and/or verification, and am always excited to learn about new technologies.`,
